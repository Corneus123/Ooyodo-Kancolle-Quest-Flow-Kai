* Get ready: A list of required elements (ships, equipments...) is calculated depending on your progress when clicking a quest (multiple selection possible with right-click!).

You don't know where you are in your quest completion? Don't worry and ask Ooyodo to do that for you.

  * Periodic quests reset: The periodic quests (dailies / weeklies / monthlies / quarterlies) will reset at the same time as the servers.
  * Updating you progress: When you complete a quest in game, you can easily update your flowchart by selecting the quest an setting it to completed.
  * Procrastination: Periodic quests are sometime a bother to update all the time, so Ooyodo will forgive you if you don't do it, but she won't for one-time quests.
  * Advices: Sometimes a periodic quest will block your progression and you will have to do it again even though you did it once in the past. Ooyodo will notify you in those cases.
