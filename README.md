Caution!
The site is still in beta version, there might be some problems remaining. If you find anything strange let me know.
Browser: The application is develloped to work on Chrome, it's not compatible with Internet explorer, and the results are not garanteed on other browser.
Performances: The application can be quite slow (especially at the beginning where the whole flowchart is created) if used on not powerful computers. If people are unable to use it I can work on a lighter version by removing some of the secondary functions.
Content: You found some inconsistencies between the game and the application? It's possible, the data used are the one collected by the community and might not be 100% accurate. Some information differ from a site to another.
Utilisation: If some functions are complicated or feel uninstictive to use, let me know.
Improvement: There is a thing you want to do and think it can be useful to imprive this site, send me your ideas.
